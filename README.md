# Anti-Money-Luandering-

**Overview And Scope** 

Anti Money Laundering (AML) is the execution of transactions to eventually convert illegally obtained money into legal money. AML legislation is becoming increasingly strict for financial service providers.

Stages of anti-money laundering
The money laundering process includes 3 stages: 
1. Placement 
2. Layering
3. Integration.

The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing ( Prevention) Act  (WWFT) - an anti-money laundering act was created to prevent money laundering that finances terrorism.

**Business Problem**

As international money transfers become more automated, it becomes easier for criminals to transfer money across borders in a fraction of a second. 
Design a model to address illegal financial activities like money laundering.The main objective of this model is to recognize such illegitimate transaction so we can take some legal action in order to improve money transaction system.

**Objective**

Minimize illegal transactions
Maximize transaction transparency 

**Constraints**

Maximize customers privacy

Minimize the cost

Minimize loss of customer's trust

Maximize model accuracy

**Data Collection**

  We are using a synthetic dataset which is generated using aggregated data from the private data that mimics the regular functioning of transactions and injects harmful behavior to test the effectiveness of fraud detection algorithms later on. Here we are working on 10000 sample values.
